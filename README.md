# boardgame_ai

This project implements a game engine that allows AIs to play Monopoly. 

It runs locally in your browser. Easiest way to try it out is to download the ZIP
with the code, extract all the files to a folder and open index.html. The Dummy AIs
will start playing immediately.

It implements all Chance and Community chest cards from the standard english 
game. 

The AIs are added in the function ResetGame

Legend: 
"GOJ": Get out of jail card
Colored circle on the board: Players current location
Colored rectangle around property: Owned by that player
Colored rectangle but with a cross: Mortaged property
